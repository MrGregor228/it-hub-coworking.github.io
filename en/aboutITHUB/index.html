                    <p><img src="images/card1.jpg" class="card-images"> New technical appliances, the high-speed
                        internet, the unique space in the center of the city: the IT hub and co-working were opened at
                        the Kryvyi Rih Economic Institute.<br>

                        The first IT-hub and co-working were opened at KEI with the financial support of the “Metinvest”
                        company and the PO “Kryvyi Rih Foundation of Future”. The multifunctional working rooms are
                        located in the separate block of the Kryvyi Rih Economic Institute on Liberation Square,
                        2.<br><br>

                        The format of “flexible offices” for training and operation, the realization of meetings,
                        conferences and trainings has already existed in Ukraine for several years. Such direction is
                        new for Kryvyi Rih, that’s why the initiators of the project - the administration of the Kryvyi
                        Rih Economic Institute – monitored the run of the operations carefully - from the creation of
                        the project documentation to the testing of the technical capabilities of the site. The key
                        partner at all the stages, from the re-training to the sound operation of the Hub and the
                        Co-working, was the “Metinvest Digital” company – the leader of the IT market of Ukraine,
                        specializing in digital transformation of business, the development of services and training
                        programs for the higher educational establishments. The project’s Coordinator is the PO "Kryvyi
                        Rih Foundation of Future".<br><br>

                        “Co-working is an important infrastructure project for Kryvyi Rih, and it’s also one of the
                        tools that can influence the choice of students to stay in their native city, to search for the
                        solutions, to communicate and to develop. This format is also convenient for both the
                        entrepreneurs-beginners and for the experienced businessmen. It has the excellent technical
                        possibilities and a good atmosphere to generate the ideas and to create the important projects
                        for the city and the country”, - said Andrii Shaikan, the director of the Kryvyi Rih Economic
                        Institute.<br><br>

                        Everyone, who wishes, can attend IT hub and co-working. But for KEI students, the platform will
                        become the additional place for the realization of the innovative studies and meetings with the
                        stakeholders.<br><br>

                        “The creation of such hub in Kryvyi Rih is the important stage of the educational system’s
                        development in the city. The very important role is given preference to the space, where you
                        want to be, where you wish to communicate and gain the new knowledge. This platform is an
                        example of modern approaches to education for the higher educational establishments of the whole
                        region”,- stressed Oleg Sharov, the general director of the Directorate of Higher and Adult
                        Education of the Ministry of Education and Science of Ukraine.<br><br>

                        IT- community.<br><br>
